The main contributions of this work were to propose a methodology to treat and transform the collected data from a vibration system that simulated a sensors and to build a dataset to train and test an Artificial Neural Network capable of predicting the future condition of the equipment, pointing out when a failure can happen.
To achieve this goal, a device model was built to simulate typical vibrational sensors, consisting of several magnets. Measurements were made using an accelerometer, and the data were collected and processed to produce a structured dataset.
I performed deep learning technique called LSTM(RNN), to demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks mainly in their generalizability.
The results of the work confirm that it is possible to use neural networks to perform predictive tasks in relation to the conditions of industrial equipment. This is an important area of study that helps to support the growth of smart industries![image](https://github.com/SKS200/sks.github.io/assets/75129079/02ba7633-45da-48f3-b97a-367f29e1f146)
